Hi, Iâ€™m Yakiv Kot, a Hive Helsinki student and a father.  
Looking for a Trainee or Junior position at an IT company. I am interested in automation, RPA, embedded systems. I would like to learn more about machine learning. And of course am open to try myself in other areas.  
I have some experience in Front-end, but am not interested in Web development
